<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In New-York, there are a number
of Market Houses. Those called
Fulton and Washington Markets are
the largest. Fulton Market is at the
East end of Fulton-street, near the
East River, and the Washington
Market is on the West end, near the
North River. The first was formerly
situated in Maiden-lane, on the East
River side, and was called Fly Market.
The latter was also in Maiden-lane,
near Broadway, and went by the
name of Bear Market. These are the
two principal markets. The next in
size is Catherine Market, in Catherine-street,
East River. There is
also, Franklin Market, in Old Slip;
Centre Market, in Grand, near
Orange-street; Clinton Market, North
River, foot of Canal-street; Essex
Market, Essex-street; Grand-street
Market, at the Williamsburgh Ferry;
and the Tomkins Market, at the junction
of the Third Avenue and the
Bowery.</p>

<p><i>New-York</i>, 1831</p>

<h2>SUSAN AND EDWARD.</h2>

<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan and Edward</span> were
two engaging little children.
Their parents lived in Pearl-street,
in the great city of
New-York, where the houses
stand close together like the
rows of young peach or apple
trees in a farmer's nursery.
Some of the houses are
two, some three, and others
even four and five stories
high, so that a skilful boy,
with a good crossbow, could
scarcely shoot an arrow over
them. Pearl-street, in which
they lived, is almost as crooked
as the letter <i>S</i>, for it begins
at the Battery, near
Broadway, and ends in Broadway,
opposite the Hospital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> was the eldest; a
modest child, not forward or
bold in her manners; very
fond of play, and sometimes
idle; but (to her praise be it
said) she was obedient to her
parents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> was younger;
a pert, active little boy; full
of talk, and very lively and
engaging in his actions;
sometimes very observing,
and would ask quite sensible
questions for a lad of five
years old.</p>

<p>One pleasant morning in
Autumn, Susan and Edward
asked liberty to go with their
mother to Fulton Market.
Having been put in neat trim,
with joyful hearts they set
off, each with a small basket,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to carry home some light
articles, which their mother
might buy. Away they went
through Franklin Square,
down Pearl-street to Peck-slip,
then turning into Water-street,
they came to Fulton-street,
at the foot of
which stands the market.</p>

<p>See here they are all going
towards the market.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i007.png" width="350" height="253" alt="With their mother" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fulton Market is a large
building, filling up a whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
square, and is erected near
the East River, opposite the
town of Brooklyn, and close
to the ferry that crosses over
to that thriving village.</p>

<p>Now the first object that
caught the sight of the children,
were the Butchers'
Stalls, hung full of beef, pork,
veal, mutton, all for sale for
ready pay to whoever will
step up to buy. The little
visiters saw the men and
boys busy whetting their
long knives, and cutting and
sawing up the meat in suitable
pieces for the buyers.
The noise was something
like a company of mowers
whetting their scythes, and
their voices and motion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
might be compared to a hive
of bees.</p>

<p>Their mother having got
of the butcher, her supply of
meat, they next visited the
fish stalls.&mdash;"O mother! mother!"
said the lively little
boy, "see the fish all jumping
alive. O look there! there!"
Sure enough, here were fish,
just out of the river, where
the fishermen keep them in
wooden cars or boxes, under
water, till wanted to be put
on the stall. See here is a
picture of a Salmon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i009.png" width="400" height="148" alt="Salmon" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The children took a walk
around, to see the different
kinds of fish, displayed on
the stalls. Here were to be
seen the Sea-Bass, Black-fish,
the Sheep's-Head, the Pike,
the Flounder, and a number
of others, so many that it
would fill a good part of this
little book, just to print the
pictures of them all. But
we will give them one; this
is the Flounder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i010.png" width="400" height="248" alt="Flounder" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then passing along they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
came to the Oyster and Clam
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sta ds'">stands</ins>. "Mother, I do want
<i>one</i> oyster," said little modest
Susan. "Only look
what a big pile. Mother,
may I have a clam?" said the
boy. The men would quickly
wait on them, by giving
each what they asked for as
a taste, and then add fifty or
a hundred more to fill the tin
kettle, for the family's supply.
We will now print a
picture of an Oyster opened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i011.png" width="250" height="198" alt="Oyster" title="" />
</div>

<p>A large curious animal laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
under one of the stalls. The
children's attention was
drawn to it. "Do see, mother,
what is that!" "It is
a Turtle," replied their mother.
So they went and
looked at it near by. It laid
on its back to prevent its
crawling away. The fisherman
was kind enough to let
the young visiters look at it
till they were tired&mdash;and then
away they went to another
part of the market. But we
will first show them a picture
of a Turtle: see there he is
on the next page, almost big
enough to frighten any body.</p>

<p>These turtles are esteemed
a great delicacy. People
bring them all the way from
the West Indies, and sell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
them for a high price to the
keepers of the hotels, who
make soup of them; the
signs may be seen hanging
at the doors, in large capital
letters; "TURTLE SOUP
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK,
THIS DAY&mdash;FAMILIES
SUPPLIED."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i013.png" width="425" height="247" alt="Turtle" title="" />
</div>

<p>After this they went to
another part of the building
called the Country Market.
Here they were delighted
with what they saw; and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
great many sights there were
for such little prattlers. "O
see, here is a Rabbit with a
white tail! see, see, Susan&mdash;do
come this way." But Susan
had her fine blue eyes also
engaged in viewing a cage of
Pigeons, some of which had
their tails spread like a fan.
They saw also a great many
baskets of Peaches, Apples,
Potatoes, and Pumpkins,
Watermelons, Cantaleupes,
pile upon pile, enough to
make one ask, 'Where are
all these to go? Who will
buy them?' But we must
remember, that there are
more than 200,000 mouths to
eat three or four times a day
in New-York, enough to
make way with the loads of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
vegetables that are brought
here every day for sale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i015.png" width="347" height="350" alt="Peacock" title="" />
</div>

<p>There was a Peacock in
one of the coops, with a long
handsome tail. This was a
great sight for these young
visiters. The feathers were
beautiful and of many colors;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
but he did not spread his
tail before so many people;
besides he had not a suitable
place; for they, being a
proud bird, like to be where
the sun shines, and where
they can strut about, with
their tail spread, when they
make a most striking show.</p>

<p>In short, here were sights
enough to keep them looking
half the day, if their mother
could have spared the time.
There were coops of chickens,
ducks, geese, turkeys,
guinea hens, bantas, and even
quails alive! We have not
room to add pictures of all
these: but we will one. See
here is a gobble turkey, who
looks as if he was ready to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
fly at any body dressed in
red.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/i017.png" width="322" height="350" alt="Turkey" title="" />
</div>

<p>So they spent some time
very pleasantly at the market,
and did not seem hardly
willing to come home, when
their mother had finished
supplying all her wants.
But at her call, like good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
obedient children, they turned
their faces homeward, and,
hand in hand, went up <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Futon'">Fulton</ins>-street
to Pearl-street, then
up through Franklin Square,
having their little baskets filled
with apples and peaches.
When they arrived at their
home, with what delight and
animation did they tell about
what they had seen! and
long will they remember the
morning walk with their mother
to Fulton Market.</p>
